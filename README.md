**Light and Sound Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Yash Patki**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/deadpan-discovered-chestnut

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Made the playback speeds a little faster than the tutorial, but at a constant speed.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

CSS Documentation/StackOverflow helped me with simple CSS changes that I wanted to make with margins, padding, and colors.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

I faced a few challenges when creating this submission like figuring out how to write CSS/Javascript code to customize my website and how to upload my Glitch project to GitHub. I have created websites in the past with software like WordPress with drag and drop tools and easy input replacing all the coding, thus I have some background in web design and know a little about all the ways to manipulate what the users see. To learn how to implement those changes through code, I referred to a few basic HTML/CSS and Javascript tutorials on YouTube and found specific techniques on StackOverflow. Not only did I learn how to code certain elements that I merely inputted in WordPress, but I realized there are a wide variety of ways to design, animate, and manipulate any component of the screen using the three languages in combination. To address the second issue of being unable to export my Glitch project to GitHub, I emailed CodePath and found the CodePath Prework Support Slack group. In the group, I reached out to the TAs and peers facing similar problems as me and figured out the solution to my issue was using a different device to export my project. The group was very understanding and helpful, so I am glad I asked for help.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Having completed my submission, I wondered about the exact thought process, design process, and coding structure that go into more extensive, impactful projects like e-commerce websites, blogs, etc. While we merely followed instructions to learn the basics of HTML/CSS and simple Javascript functions, I am curious about how large businesses/corporations organize teams and plan the creation of their website to meet their users' needs. There needs to be a well-constructed plan before any coding as each individual must understand their role within the team, but I would love to learn about how to effectively and efficiently communicate and collaborate on large-scale projects. 

Additionally, when coding this simple memory game, I was slightly overwhelmed by having to update and track three separate files (html, css, js) at the same time, and I imagine larger projects must have a lot more sources to manage, so how do experienced developers keep track of all their changes across all these files?

Finally, with all these new tools like WIX, SquareSpace, WordPress making web development significantly easier without needing to learn how to code, is traditional web development in danger of being taken over in the tech industry? Will companies still hire web developers in the future as things start to become more accessible for everyone lacking coding experience and knowledge?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
